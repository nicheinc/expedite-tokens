# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

    Ideally we would adhere to semver, but it's a little wild west for now,
    so until we strictly do (maybe 2.0.0), we should omit that statement from
    the Changelog. At that time, we should change the statement below to:

    The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
